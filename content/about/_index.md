### What is a voxel ?

The term 'Voxel' stands for 'Volumetric Pixel', it is the 3D equivalent of a
pixel in two dimensions.  Just like 2D images can be represented has a
pixel grid, 3D images can be represented as a 3D grid, where each point of
the grid represents the color at a given position.

Most conventional 3D editors don't use voxels, but instead represent the
model as a set of triangles.  This is similar to the difference between
vectorial and bitmap graphics.
