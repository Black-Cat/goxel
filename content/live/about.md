# About Goxel Live Version

The [live version](/live) of Goxel is an *experimental* javascript port of the code
usable directly in the browser.

At the moment, some of the functionalities are not working (like the path
tracer), and it might not work on all browsers.  Also, if you close the tab
or navigate to an other one, you will lose your work!

If you want to use goxel fully, it is better to download the appropriate
version in the [download](/download) page.
