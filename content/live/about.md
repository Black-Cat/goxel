# About Goxel Live Version

The [live version](/live) of Goxel is an *experimental* javascript port of the
code usable directly in the browser.

At the moment there are many limitations:

- It only works on desktop.
- The path tracing rendering doesn't work.
- The model is not save if you close the page (be warned!)
- Generally this is not tested much.

If you want to use Goxel fully, it is better to download the appropriate
version in the [download](/download) page.
